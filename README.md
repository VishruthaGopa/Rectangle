Start by creating a task list for your project
# TASK LIST

- [x] 1.Define the class.
- [x] 2.Write a constructor method called Rectangle that has no parameters, which sets all fields to zero.
- [X] 3.Write a second constructor method that has four integer parameters, which sets all fields of the class.
- [X] 5.Write a mutator method called set that has four integer parameters representing the four fields of the class.
- [X] 6.Write a toString instance method.
- [X] 7.Write an instance method, area, that returns the integer area of the calling rectangle. Have it
return zero for lines and points.
- [X] 8.Write an instance method, perimeter, that returns the perimeter of the calling rectangle. Ensure
that the perimeter of any straight line is the lineâ€™s length (not twice its length).
- [X] 9.Write an instance method, contains, that has one parameter of type Rectangle. The method
should return true if every point of the specified rectangle (i.e. passed by the explicit parameter) is within the implicit parameter (i.e. the object invoking the instance method). It should return false otherwise.
- [X] 10.Write a class method, intersection, that has two Rectangle parameters.
- [X] 11.Create a separate file that displays pictorially all the tests you conducted to test your intersection method. (Include coordinates and diagrams for each unique test case).
- [X] 12.Write a class method, totalPerimeter, that has two Rectangle parameters. The method
should return the total perimeter, as an integer, of the figure formed by the two rectangles. It
should only count those portions that are on the edges of the exterior of the resulting figure. If one rectangle is completely contained by the other, then return the perimeter of the outer rectangle. If the rectangles do not intersect, the method should return the sum of the individual perimeters.

## 4+
- [X] 13.Have the testing program prompt a user for each of the four fields for two rectangles and then
make use of ALL of the class and instance methods. Have this output to the console in an
organized fashion.
- [X] 14.As well, output the following specific outputs to a named text file called Rectangles.txt
- [X] 15.Have the information from the rectangle be organized and outputted with labels formatted(See note)
- [X] 16.Prevent in your Client Code any/all compiler and run-time errors to the testing program
- [X] 17.Have a public instance method called toFile to accomplish this part 

## Bonus 
- [X] Use processing to have your program become a visualized program. Have two rectangles start at opposite sides of the screen and move to their final resting places.
