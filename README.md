# Rectangle Program

The Rectangle Program is an object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation that allows users to create rectangle objects and calculate various properties such as area, perimeter, point of intersection between two rectangles, and properties of an intersecting rectangle formed by overlapping rectangles.

### Visualized Program (Processing)
- The program utilizes Processing to visualize the rectangles. Two rectangles start at opposite sides of the screen and move to their final positions.

## Input
- The program prompts the user for the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, and height of two rectangles.

## Output
- The calculated properties of the rectangles are displayed in the console and written to "Rectangles.txt."


#### Additional Instructions
- [X] Write a class method, totalPerimeter, that has two Rectangle parameters. The method should return the total perimeter, as an integer, of the figure formed by the two rectangles. It should only count those portions that are on the edges of the exterior of the resulting figure. If one rectangle is completely contained by the other, then return the perimeter of the outer rectangle. If the rectangles do not intersect, the method should return the sum of the individual perimeters.
- [X] Have the testing program prompt a user for each of the four fields for two rectangles and then make use of ALL of the class and instance methods. Have this output to the console in an organized fashion.
- [X] As well, output the following specific outputs to a named text file called Rectangles.txt
- [X] Have the information from the rectangle be organized and outputted with labels formatted(See note)
- [X] Prevent in your Client Code any/all compiler and run-time errors to the testing program
- [X] Have a public instance method called toFile to accomplish this part 
- [X] Use processing to have your program become a visualized program. Have two rectangles start at opposite sides of the screen and move to their final resting places.
